# Character Details

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png>)

## Character Bio

At the top left of the page is the Character Bio. It shows some information about the Character whose page you are currently on; their avatar from the Lodestone, name and world information.

This information is not editable due to how Characters are imported.

This box will have some functionality added to it later!

## Navigation

Below the Character Bio card is a small card that allows for switching between sections of the Character page.

If any extra sections can be added to the Character page, they will be added to the Navigation just like BIS Lists and Teams.

Only displaying one section at a time allows the page to display a lot more detail than it could when it was displaying everything at once!

## BIS Lists

The BIS Lists section shows all of the Character's BIS Lists, in the same format as they are displayed on the [team-details.md](../teams/team-details.md "mention") page.

The major difference between the displays on the Team and Character pages is as follows;

On the Team page, colours are generated using the max item level of the Tier the Team is currently in.&#x20;

On the Character page, because there is no link between BIS Lists and a Tier, the colours are generated using the item level of the Gear in the BIS Mainhand slot. Typically, this will be the raid weapon so it will correspond with a Tier's maximum item level anyway, but it is worth keeping in mind in case your BIS weapon is not the one that drops from the raid.

{% hint style="info" %}
For safety and less confusion, the cards on the Character page contain a message stating the item level they use to generate the colours beneath the table.
{% endhint %}

To edit an existing BIS List, click the "Edit" link at the bottom of the corresponding card. To create a new BIS List, click the purple "Add New" button above the lists.

## Teams

The Teams section shows all of the Teams the Character is a part of, in a similar format to how they are displayed on the Home page. There are four sections of note to how each Team is displayed.

The dark box around each Team is a link, and clicking anywhere on the dark box will take you to that Team's page.

The blue P icon to the left indicates that the Character is a regular Member of the Team. If they were instead the Team Leader, the icon displayed would be ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>) instead.

To the right of the icon, is the name of the Team. Below that is the name of the Tier the Team is currently working on.

At the bottom of the box, there is a set of Job icons. This is a list of icons of all the jobs of the Characters on the Team.

On mobile, only the name of the Team and its Tier are displayed.
