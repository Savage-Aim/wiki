# Dev Roadmap

Below is a list of items I want to work on, in order of priority. You can skip this page if you're looking to get into the helpful part of the Wiki.

## Live Notifications

Given the nature of Savage Aim, with Teams of multiple Characters belonging to multiple people, I feel like it's worth having some sort of notification system in place for live updates.

For some examples, notifying when a verification request has been completed, or failed, and some information about it.

It will also be helpful in the next big update in notifying people of changes that were made by someone else.

## Deleting Objects

I've left this out of the current app for now for a valid (in my opinion anyway) reason.

The handling of deleting objects needs to cascade in the correct way and I wanted to sit down and have the chance to think about that and only that at a later point.

For example, deleting Characters would need to either update or delete Teams, BIS Lists etc.

Deleting a Team would need to notify people that it happened (see above).

Kicking members from a team, or leaving a team yourself, would be important places to start. They're relatively easy and don't affect too much.&#x20;

But I want to have notifications set up first.
