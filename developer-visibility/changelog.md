# Changelog

&#x20;![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1).png>)

Whenever a new version is deployed, or if you click the Changelog link at the bottom of every page, you will be able to see the Changelog modal.

This is just a way for you to be kept up to date with things that have changed with new deployments, since it won't always be obvious.

## Layout and Versioning

While the site is not at 1.0, the layout of the Changelog hasn't really been set in stone, but here is some indication of what you can expect.

Savage Aim uses Semantic Versioning; 3 numbers separated by dots. The pattern for SemVer is `major-version.minor-version.patch-version`

For example, `0.1.0` is major version 0, minor version 1, and patch version 0

### Major Changes

This section contains the changes that were added that made the `minor version` to change. While in pre 1.0, this number only changes for new functionality implementations, and these will be listed in this section.

### Minor Changes

This section is updated every time the `patch version` changes. This version is increased whenever there are new bugfix or minor implementation (like a new colour scheme) are released.
