### About The Wiki

Here we aim to have a collection of information to help with any questions you may have about using Savage Aim!

The system is open source and you can report issues or view the whole code at https://github.com/Savage-Aim/app&#x20;

If needed, there can also be a Discord server set up with more direct opportunities to contact the main dev.

For the most part, you can follow the sidebar on the left like a guide to setting yourself up fully. Otherwise you can search at the top or through the sidebar for specifics if that's all you need!

### About Savage Aim

Savage Aim is a Best in Slot (BiS) gear tracker for FFXIV Savage players and statics. It aims to provide a clear and helpful indication of how people are progressing towards their Best in Slot for a given raid tier for any of their jobs.

It was written in time for Pandaemonium Asphodelos, and it will be kept up to date with future gear releases and raid tiers for the foreseeable future.
