# Team Settings

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png>)

This page is for Team Leaders only, and allows them to update some settings about the Team.

## Invite Code

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>)

This box provides the **invite code** and **invite link** required for other users to have their Characters join the Team. You can provide either the code in the input, or the URL linked below, to potential new Members.

### Regenerate

With the addition of the ability to kick members from the Team, the ability to regenerate invite codes has also been added.&#x20;

To ensure that kicked Characters can't return to the Team using the link you previously sent them, you (as the Team Leader) may first want to regenerate your invite code, so that when you do kick a Character, they should not be able to return to the Team.

## Settings

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (27) (1).png>)

This box contains all the settings that can be changed for a Team.

### Team Name

Similar to [#team-name](create-a-team.md#team-name "mention"), max of 64 characters long.

### Tier

Here you can change the Tier the Team is currently raiding in.

### Team Lead

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please be aware that changing this setting will make you no longer the Team Leader if you change it to a Character not owned by you. Please be sure you are changing it to the right person.
{% endhint %}

You can use this dropdown to pick a new Team Leader. This can be reversed only by the newly appointed Leader.

### Save

Clicking the Save button will send the request to update the Team's settings.&#x20;

If successful, a green notification should pop up and say so. If not, any erroneous inputs will be highlighted in red and have error text displayed to indicate what went wrong.

### Disband

If you wish to disband a Team completely, you may use the red Disband button at the bottom right of the page. A confirmation dialog will pop up to ensure you are confident in the request.

Filling in the name of the Team into the box will allow you to click the Disband button on the popup, and remove the Team from the system.&#x20;

This will also send [#team\_disband](../notifications.md#team\_disband "mention") Notifications to every other Team Member to inform them.
