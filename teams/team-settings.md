# Team Settings

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

This page is for Team Leaders only, and allows them to update some settings about the Team.

## Invite Code

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

This box provides the **invite code** and **invite link** required for other users to have their Characters join the Team. You can provide either the code in the input, or the URL linked below, to potential new Members.

{% hint style="info" %}
There is a plan to implement a regenerate feature here.
{% endhint %}

## Settings

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

This box contains all the settings that can be changed for a Team.

### Team Name

Similar to [#team-name](create-a-team.md#team-name "mention"), max of 64 characters long.

### Tier

Here you can change the Tier the Team is currently raiding in.

### Raid Lead

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please be aware that changing this setting will make you no longer the Team Leader if you change it to a Character not owned by you. Please be sure you are changing it to the right person.
{% endhint %}

You can use this dropdown to pick a new Raid Lead, or Team Leader. This can be reversed only by the newly appointed Leader.

### Save

Clicking the Save button will send the request to update the Team's settings.&#x20;

If successful, a green notification should pop up and say so. If not, any erroroneous inputs will be highlighted in red and have error text displayed to indicate what went wrong.
